<center><h1>üë®‚Äçüíª Python Project Guide</h1></center>

A practical guide to organizing, documenting, and maintaining clean Python projects ‚Äî whether for Deep Learning, Data Science, or Software Engineering.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Folder Structure

Always use a clean and modular structure:

```bash
my_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                 # Project overview, installation, and usage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt          # List of Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore                # Files and folders to exclude from version control
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ venv/                     # Virtual environment (excluded from Git)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/                   # Centralized configuration for paths, parameters, etc.
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml           # YAML file storing configurable paths or hyperparameters
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                      # Main application code (organized by function or logic)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py               # Entry point script
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dataset.py            # Dataset loading and preprocessing logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model.py              # Model architecture definitions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train.py              # Training loop
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.py              # General utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                    # Unit and integration tests
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_*.py             # Individual test files
```

* `src/`: Contains your actual training, inference, and business logic.
* `config/`: Stores one or more `.yaml` (for path structures), `.json`(for light data storage) or `.env` (for environment variables). These files can be easily loaded in your Python scripts with the libraries `yaml`, `json`and `dotenv` respectively.
* `tests/`: Ensures all key functionality is verifiable.
* `venv/`: Local project environment, kept out of version control.
* `requirements.txt`: Captures dependencies used in the project.
* `.gitignore`: Prevents accidental commits of logs, temp files, environments, etc.
* `README.md`: Provides project setup, usage, and documentation.

> Optional directories like `notebooks/`, `scripts/`, or `data/` should be added only when necessary and clearly documented.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Function Documentation (PEP 257 Style)

Clear function documentation improves readability, usability, and maintainability. When writing your functions, you should:
- Use type hints in the function signature.
- Include a docstring that describes what the function does.
- Use `:param` and `:return` tags to document each input and output.

Template Example:

```python
def function(parameter_1: str,
             parameter_2: bool = False) -> List[float]:
    """
    Load numerical data from a file.

    :param parameter_1: Parameter 1 description.
    :param parameter_2: Parameter 2 description.
    
    :return: Returned object.
    """

    # your code here

    pass
```

> Keep your descriptions short but clear. Mention any assumptions or side effects if needed.

This format is ideal for auto-generated documentation tools and makes code easier to navigate for collaborators and future-you.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Virtual Environments & Dependency Tracking

It's good practice to activate a virtual environment when working on any Python project, ensuring your dependencies remain isolated and controlled. All the dependencies are kept into a `requirements.txt` file that specify the name of the library used and eventually its version:

Example:

```bash
Python>=3.8  # Python version
torch>=1.13  # Package version greater or equal than
numpy==2.2.3  # Exact version needed
scikit-learn  # No version specified (the latest for your Python will be used)
```

You can automatically generate a `requirements.txt` with the `pipreqs` package:

```bash
pip install pipreqs
```

```bash
pipreqs ./  # Scans your code and creates a minimal requirements.txt
```

When starting a project or collaborating, you can install the requirements specified with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note**: in order to keep the testing environment clean to avoid any bugs due to package versions, it's important to create a single Virtual Environment to contains the necessary libraries with the needed versions.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Writing a clear README.md

Your `README.md` is the first place users, collaborators, and future-you will look to understand how your project works. It should serve as both a quick-start guide and high-level documentation. Recommended sections are:

- **Project Title and Description**.
- **Installation**: List dependencies and how to install them.
- **Configuration**: Explain how to configure the project. If using configuration files, include an example or point to one in the repository.
- **Project Structure**: Briefly describe the folder structure and what each directory/file is responsible for.
- **Usage**: Show how to run key scripts (e.g. training, testing, inference). 

Here follow a good structure to describe your Python script:

```markdown
### `your_script.py`

**Description**  
Briefly describe what this script does.  
_Example: This script trains a neural network on a dataset using the configuration defined in a YAML file._

**Requirements**  
List any files, pre-setup, or directories needed before running this script.

- Fill out the configuration file at `config/train_config.yaml`
- Ensure the dataset is located in the `data/` directory
- Create an empty `checkpoints/` folder for saving models

**Arguments**

| Argument         | Type    | Description                                   | Required | Default         |
|------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------|
| `--config`       | string  | Path to the configuration file                | Yes      | -               |
| `--epochs`       | int     | Number of training epochs                     | No       | `10`            |
| `--batch_size`   | int     | Size of each training batch                   | No       | `64`            |
| `--save_dir`     | string  | Directory to save trained model checkpoints   | No       | `./checkpoints` |
| `--eval_only`    | flag    | Run in evaluation mode only                   | No       | `False`         |

**Examples**

Train the model using a specific configuration:

    ```bash
    python your_script.py --config config/train_config.yaml --epochs 100
    ```

Evaluate a pre-trained model:

    ```bash
    python your_script.py --config config/eval_config.yaml --eval_only
    ```

**Notes**  
- Logging output will be saved to the `logs/` directory, if enabled in the config.
- The script will automatically create the `save_dir` if it doesn't exist.
```

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Version Control

Use Git for everything ‚Äî code, configs,
dependency files -  in order to keep track of any changes.

You can find a good Git Guide [here](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).
